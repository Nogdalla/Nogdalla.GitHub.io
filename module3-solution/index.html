			Beef
		</div>
		<p>
			  Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging; in one common aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.

			 For sushi at one of the best Japanese restaurants in Dubai, head to Akira Back. From Michelin-starred chef Akira Back, this restaurant at Palm Jumeirah’s W Dubai – The Palm is a top choice for sushi. The rolls are fantastic, our top pick is the Pop Rockin’ stuffed with spicy crab, cucumber and asparagus. The Japanese restaurant in Dubai also serves up excellent vegan dishes, including vegan sushi such as the vegan rainbow roll with marinated tomato, smoked mango, grilled asparagus, kombucha ponzu. The views across to Dubai Marina are stunning, and it’s also one of the most romantic restaurants in Dubai so ideal for a date night.
